# Week2Assessment
 Week 2 assessment practicing how to use JUnit tests and Maven.
This project demonstrates how to use JUnit tests and add Maven to your project as well. 
It is useful in seeing how to properly write and run JUnit tests.
You can get started by creating your own project, converting your project to a Maven Project, adding JUnit test cases, etc. Also by adding in simple java code to test and see if it it properly working.
You can get help by researching various information on the internet (W3 schools is a helpful example). I was also able to use info from my Java ll college course.
I am the sole person who updates and maintains this repo.
